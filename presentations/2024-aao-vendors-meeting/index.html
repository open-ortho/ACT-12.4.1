				<h2>Who am I? What are my objectives?</h2>
				<div class="">
					<ul>
						<li>Family of Orthodontists, no clinical passion, biomedical engineer, IT, devops, software dev.
						</li>
						<li>I attend the needs of the doctors (not the patients).</li>

						<li>Exchange of medical data via open-standards becomes the norm.</li>

							This whole thing started from a conversation i had with a fellow of yours, a <a
								href="../.././assets/img/moullas.jpg">Greek Orthodontic student</a> back in 2000.
						</li>
						<li>
							I am here because I feel there is a certain level of ignorance which is harming both doctors
							and software vendors.
						</li>
						<li>
							Personal Goal: to bring orthodontic domain (and others outside of large institutions, and
							public health systems) to a level of interoperability in which making use of open-standards
							is given for granted, similarly to the way it is today for shipping containers.

				<h2>Presentation Goals</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						to provide you with a basic level of understanding of what open-standards based interoperability
						is,

					<li>
						to show how you can use it at your advantage
					</li>
					<li>
						to educate that its implementation, contrary to popular belief, is not a liability, it is an
						asset

				<h2>The role of i14y in an AI driven world</h2>
				<div class="r-stack">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							What is it even needed for? AI could do all the conversion between devices.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							True, but at high price:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Training and Inference require time and resources (human, electrical, hardware).
								</li>
								<li>
									Accuracy is not guaranteed.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						It is very hard to take completely unstructured data, or unknown structure structured data, and
						make sense of it with a very high precision/accuracy, one that will guarantee not to put
						patients at risk.

					</p>
					<p>
						We can see this with self driving, where everyone can get a self-driving vehicle to perform
						extremely well 80% of the time. Its the last 20% or even 5% or even 1% that is the hardest.
						Humans are not willing to put up with any death caused by machine errors, even though we are
						willing to put up with deaths caused by human error.
					</p>
					<p>
						Container example:
						Technically, today, in the robot era, we don't need a shipping container standard: we can have
						robots do all of the loading and unloading of oddly sized and shaped bags, boxes, crates,
						envelopes when unloading and loading trucks, ships and trains.
						But if you are en engineer, you would know that it is easier to build robots that only have to
						deal with one or two sized objects.
						Story:
						Websites which provide so much detail and limitations to generate secure passwords.
						What are they doing?
						They are effectively specifying a "standard" (even though custom/proprietary), for their
						password.
						This makes it a lot easier for hackers designing and performing brute-force attacks on these
						passwords: now they have a reduced/limited dataset of password to deal with.
						Why help hackers? Have them waste time going through all the easy passwords!

				<h2>When the standards can't do what you need</h2>
				<p class="fragment">
					Standards exist to help technology grow, not to obstacle it.
				</p>
				<div class="r-stack">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							Take advantage of it as much as possible.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Extend the standard with whatever you need
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">

					When the standards can't do what you need.
					The standards are not here to slow down technology development, or to create obstacles for it. They
					are here to help foster it, to make it grow.
					Therefore, when the standard is not able to cover what you need to do, you should still use it! Do
					this:
					use the standard as far as you can, making use of the advantages.
					extend the standard with whatever you need, being as idiomatic as possible (to the best of your
					knowledge). All standards have one way or another to add more to them using some kind of "private"
					or "custom" fields/codes.
					This will not break the standard, but, yes, it will create a non-interoperable format.
					Sometimes this is just fine! Because you only need to encode this information for your internal
					products.
					If what you are adding needs to be something that should be exchanged with other vendors, submit
					your new format to the standard committee. SDOs will be very happy to move things forward when there
					is a direct application and imminent need for it.
					if you already have an integration lined up with another vendor, go ahead and work it out between
					the two, while the SDOs are reviewing, whatever you submitted. This way you can also test and
					provide even better feedback to the SDO.
					While using a temporary/custom version of the standard, you can organize your code in such a way
					that the temporary version is only created upon request, and not stored: this will facilitate any
					changes you might have to do, in order to take care of new versions.

				<h2>Where to Start</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Identify the product.
					</li>
					<li>
						Identify the resources.
					</li>
					<li>
						Quantify Savings.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<aside class="notes">
					Where to start
					Identify if there is a product you have which can benefit from adopting open-based standards.
					Most amount of time and money is saved when using the above mentioned resources at the beginning, or
					in the early stages of a product development, but there are exceptions:
					Data import from other systems: when designing a system to import data from other systems, passing
					through solid standard formats can save you headaches in the long run
					Data export to other systems: when designing an API to allow other to access, you can make use of
					the existing ones, saving time for the design, testing and documentation of the API.
					...
					Identify the resources you can use for the product/project
					Are there resources that your current developers can use today, without having to spend months
					learning something?
					Are there things you can do today, without having to hire super expensive consultants to understand
					which way to go?
					Quantify the savings.
					Once a product has been identified, you need to make sure its actually worth it, that it will cost
					you less.

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<div class="r-stack">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">
							What's the point of using a standard if i have to customize it anyways?
						</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Why do all the work? Let AI do the conversion.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					<ul>
						<li>
							As long as you comply with as much of the standard as you can, you are good. You only have
							to customize the minimum necessary for you to get your job done. Never customize parts of
							the standard which break the standard. I have seen software products which do this. Don't
							re-invent the standard. The standard should always be implemented in such a way that your
							customization will still allow another implementer to correctly interpret the data, except
							for the custom element. If you do this,
						</li>
						<li>
							It is a lot cheaper to codify data once, at the beginning, than to have to re-identify and
							re-code each time for each software using AI. This just slows things down and introduces
							errors.
