                            Just tell me what it is. Lets start with when the patient walks in the door. Or actually,
                            even before that: when the patient finds out about you. What is needed to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Develop Marketing</li>

                            So therefore you must have professors, instructors and teacher covering computers every day,
                            right?

                            I have heard many stories. One such story is of an orthodontist who was happliy using
                            cepalometric tracing software A, when at some point, after a decade or two, decided to
                            switch. ...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I am frustrated because i have low tolerance for technology which actually worsens the
                            workflow compared to manual.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This whole thing started from a conversation i had with a fellow of yours, a <a
                                href="./assets/img/moullas.jpg">Greek Orthodontic student</a> back in 2000.

                        <li>
                            I am here because i would like to tell you about a problem that most of you are probably not
                            aware of or maybe conscious of.
                        </li>
                        <li>The problem is right on your face, but most you don't notice it.</li>
                        <li>
                            My objective is to provide you with information, because i believe that by being aware of
                            the problem and understanding it better, you will be able to help solve it at the root
                            level.

                            Just like there are patients who try to make money by catching medical providers make
                            clinical mistakes, there will soon be more and more patients doing the same with how
                            clinical data is handled.

                            Example of Lisy: patient wanted to sew for incorrect dosage of radiopharmaceutical. However,
                            hospital was tracking everything, and patient couldn't go anywhere. But if patient would
                            have accused the hospital of improper data handling, they would have scored without
                            problems. It's like shooting blindfolded: you will hit someone, if everyone is doing it.
