					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Orthodontic Softwares don't communicate with each other easily</li>
						<li>Providers don't know exactly how to share data between each other</li>
						<li>Providers don't know how to give patients their data</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A lot of time and resources spend for data conversion (import and export)</li>
						<li>Data conversion is a tedious repetitive process: developers keep reverse engineering and
							don't share their work.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Strategic Plan</h2>

				<section>
					<h2>How can the AAO get involved</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Require anyone that applies for AAO/AAOF funding take Interoperability into consideration.
						</li>
						<li>Regularly publish articles to educate domain on Interoperability.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Interoperability Guidelines</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							A developer should always make use of existing
							standards
						</li>
						<li>
							If there are no standards, a developer is expected to
							invent their own standard.
						</li>
						<li>
							When a new standard is invented, it shall be made
							public, and eventually adopted by and SDO.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								A developer should always make use of an existing,
								public, open, machine-readable and recognized standard
								format for exporting, importing and interchanging all of
								the data. (The intention is to prevent developers from
								holding on to the data the user has added).

							</li>
							<li>
								If a developer is developing a novel product,
								for which no such standard exists yet, the
								developer can invent their own format, as long
								as it is made public, and open for usage by
								anyone. (The intention is to allow technological
								innovation, while maintaining interoperability).
								In such circumstance:
							</li>

							<ul>

								<li>
									the developer shall facilitate/promote the
									standardization of this format through a
									recognized SDO. (The intention is that this
									new format becomes official and implemented
									by others as well)
								</li>

								<li>
									if a new versions of the format is
									necessary, the developer shall maintain
									backwards compatibility with the previously
									used format, either directly (within the new
									version of the product itself), or by
									developing and making publicly available
									open-source conversion tools.
								</li>

								<li>
									in any event, any subsequent format changes
									and revisions shall be made publicly
									available for usage, implementation and
									development, just as the first one. (The
									intention is to prevent possible abuse of
									this regulation by making the first format
									public and open, but then making revisions
									closed and proprietary)

				<h3>
					Ask you software's support these questions
				</h3>
				<p>
					Find out if you really have control over your data.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The day I decide to move to a different software
						product, what will the process to export my
						data and import it into the new software be?
					</li>
					<li>
						I would like to use Software B to send out my email
						reminders. Can you please ensure the two software
						products can share data both ways?
